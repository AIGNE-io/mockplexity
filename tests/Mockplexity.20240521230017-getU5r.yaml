      JavaScript (often abbreviated as JS) is a programming language and a core
      technology of the web, alongside HTML and CSS. Approximately 99% of
      websites use JavaScript on the client side for handling webpage behavior.
      Web browsers come with a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes this
      client-side code.


      ### Key Points About JavaScript:

      1. **Usage**: JavaScript is used extensively on the client side by
      virtually all modern websites to enhance user experience by enabling
      interactive elements.

      2. **Origins**: Initially known as LiveScript, it was renamed to
      JavaScript by Netscape to position it as a companion to Java. Despite the
      name, JavaScript and Java are not related beyond superficial syntactic
      similarities.

      3. **Capabilities**: JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted (or
      just-in-time compiled) programming language with first-class functions.
      It's also used in various non-browser environments such as Node.js, Apache
      CouchDB, and Adobe Acrobat.

      4. **Popularity**: According to various sources, including Stack Overflow,
      JavaScript is currently the most popular programming language among
      developers, used for both front-end and increasingly for back-end
      development through environments like Node.js.


      ### Learning Resources:

      - **MDN Web Docs**: Comprehensive documentation on JavaScript's syntax,
      operators, and usage.

      - **W3Schools**: A complete JavaScript reference that includes examples
      for all properties and methods.

      - **Node.js**: An open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that
      allows you to run JavaScript on the server side.

      - **Vue.js**: A progressive framework for building user interfaces.

      - **Next.js**: A React framework that includes the latest React features.
